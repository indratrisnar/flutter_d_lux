Flutter is a framework created by Google for creating cross-platform applications. So a single codebase is enough to create similar applications on other platforms. Even though Flutter can be run on many platforms, namely mobile, web and desktop, Flutter's main focus is on mobile platforms, namely using Android and iOS OS. For desktop platforms, Flutter can be run on Windows, Mac and Linux OS.

Flutter applications are built by arranging view blocks so that they look like pages and ultimately become functional applications. The term view blocks in Flutter are called Widgets, whereas in other frameworks they are called Components. Flutter runs using Dart as its programming language.

Dart is a programming language that uses the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, apart from that there is the Functional Programming paradigm but OOP is preferred. Dart has its own engine for running or executing code, namely the Dart Virtual Machine (DVM).

Dart is a derivative of the Java language, so those who have previous Java language skills will quickly master the Dart language because the syntax is similar. For practice dart code, the official provides a place to write dart code and run it on the [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/?) website accompanied by documentation. However, there are some codes and libraries that cannot be run on DartPad. For full access to Dart coding, it is recommended to use IDEA such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.

At the time this bootcamp was created, the latest stable version of Flutter was v3.10.0. For complete information, you can open the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/) websites.
