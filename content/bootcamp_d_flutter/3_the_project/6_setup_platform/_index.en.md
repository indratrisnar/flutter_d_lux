For platform setup depending on needs, what is often set is usually about permissions. For specifics added, edited depending on platform. If we use a package that is of the plugin type, then in the package readme section there are steps for configuring the setup on each platform. What is often setup is usually on mobile platforms with Android and IOS os. The way to access it is via vscode directly to a specific directory. But there are also those that require using Android Studio for the Android OS and Xcode for the IOS OS.
